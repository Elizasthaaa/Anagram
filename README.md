# Anagram

This program verifies whether two strings are anagrams or not. First, it is a comparison of the lengths of the strings. When the lengths are not the same they cannot be anagrams. It then counts the number of times each of the characters is repeated in the two strings using an array. When the number of counts of the character is zero, the strings are anagrams. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), and a space complexity of O(1).
